## Luminous Solutions - Responsive Landing Page

This repository contains the code for a responsive landing page created as part of a web development internship task. The goal was to create an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. The navigation menu should have a fixed position and be visible on all pages.

### Features

- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Fixed navigation menu with smooth scrolling and hover effects
- Attractive banner with a gradient overlay and a stylized heading
- Sections showcasing different interior design styles
- Footer with copyright information

### Getting Started

To view the landing page, you can access it at the following URL: http://luminous-solutions.mikoshi.in/

### Customization

To customize the landing page, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files according to your needs. Feel free to change the content, colors, fonts, and layout to match your brand or design preferences.


### Credits

The landing page uses the following fonts from Google Fonts:

- [Imperial Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Imperial+Script)
- [Bitter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter)
