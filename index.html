          <h2 class="work-header">Modern Interior Design</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p class="work-discription">
            Modern interior design emphasizes clean lines, minimalism, and a
            focus on functionality. It often features open floor plans, large
            windows, and a neutral color palette accented with bold pops of
            color. Modern spaces prioritize the use of natural materials, such
            as wood and stone, combined with sleek, contemporary furnishings.
            Modern furniture is characterized by its simple, geometric forms and
            the use of high-quality, durable materials. Pieces often feature
            clean lines, smooth surfaces, and a lack of ornate details.
          </p>
          <p class="work-discription"></p>
          <p class="work-discription">
            Modern design often incorporates sustainable and eco-friendly
            elements, such as the use of renewable materials, energy-efficient
            lighting, and passive solar design principles. This reflects a
            growing emphasis on environmental consciousness and a desire to
            create spaces that are not only beautiful but also environmentally
            responsible. Accent pieces, such as area rugs, throw pillows, and
            artwork, are used to add pops of color and texture, while
            maintaining the overall minimalist aesthetic.

          <h2 class="work-header">Minimalist Interior Design</h2>
          <p class="work-discription">
            Minimalist interior design focuses on simplicity, clean lines, and
            functionality. It emphasizes open spaces, neutral colors, and a
            limited number of carefully selected decor elements. Minimalist
            spaces often incorporate natural light, sleek furniture, and a
            monochromatic color palette to create a serene and uncluttered
            atmosphere.
          </p>

          <p class="work-discription">
            Form follows function in minimalist design. Spaces are organized to
            be highly practical and efficient. Built-in storage and
            multi-purpose furniture help keep surfaces clear and unencumbered.
            Minimalist color palettes typically feature neutral tones like
            white, gray, beige, and black. These colors create a calming,
            cohesive look and allow the focus to remain on the architecture and
            furnishings. Pops of color are used sparingly for visual interest.
